Damaged over time but still stands there and tells us a great story about life of Jewish citizens who inhabited Dubrovnik in medieval time.

The rest of the Old city won't be forgotten as we are going to stroll through its narrow streets that are whispering about secrets behind walls.
                            
                            Comfortable shoes, a hat, and a bottle of water are recommended.

                        <h4>Private Half Day Tour around Mighty Walls of Dubrovnik</h4>
                        <p>On this tour we are climbing on Dubrovnik's City wall. It is a 2 kilometers ( 1, 3 miles ) walk that takes some effort due to stairs on our way. There are 3 entrances so we can do the whole circle or approx half of it.

                            It is worth seeing Dubrovnik from a completely different perspective where Old town looks like on the palm of your hand. At a couple of windows, there are hidden parts of Jewish tombstones used for reconstruction by Napoleon's army. However, as a local guide I am, I know where they are.
                            
                            Even if we make half or the whole wall tour we shall see some other main sites as Onofrio's Fountain, Franciscan monastery, Rectors palace, Cathedral.
                            
                            A hat, bottle of water and some comfortable shoes are recommended.</p>
                            <p>No matter if we start from Pile or Ploce gate, after climbing on a wall and short introduction to Dubrovnik's history we'll walk the wall and after we get off from it there are many interesting buildings and monuments to see as:
                                - Domenican monastery
                                -Sponza Palace ( bank, mint, treasury )
                                - main, Placa street ( for locals Stradun )
                                -St. Blase church ( patron saint of Dubrovnik )
                                -Rector's Palace ( the Seat of Dubrovnik Republic )
                                - Old city port, Cathedral
                                - Franciscan monastery ( Old pharmacy )
                                - Big Onofrio's fountain
                                - City wall
                                Our tour can finish at the same meeting point where we started.

                            After visiting museum we'll proceed to the Old city of Dubrovnik to get further back in the past, at the beginning of existence of today's Dubrovnik.

                        <p>At this tour, we'll go from location to location where GOT was filmed. It will be fun to compare screenshots of the show in my album with actual locations.

                            As there are many similarities between GOT and real Dubrovnik history you'll see why Dubrovnik was chosen for filming GOT. We won't neglect real history tales as we visit every single location.
                            At every location, after my part, there will be enough time to take some photos where of course I am ready for help.
